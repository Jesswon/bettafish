If you want to breed Betta fish, you should know this is a dominant tail type over other variations, and therefore is one of the easiest to breed.</p>

        <h3 id="gender">Male vs. Female</h3>
        <p>Male and female bettas can be differentiated through observable traits, such as appearance and behavior.</p>
          <aside role="complementary">
            <h4>Appearance</h4>  
            <p>Male Betta fish are what you usually think of when the word “betta” comes up. Wild-caught Betta males are slightly larger and brighter than females. However, they have been bred in Thailand for centuries for long, flowing fins and punchy red and blue tones far stronger than wild males. 
Betta male colors are also strongly diet dependent. A diet rich in carotenoids, found in foods like shrimp and bloodworms, helps bring out the red and gold tones. Many prepared Betta formulas like Omega One Betta Food also contain higher levels of both protein (including whole fish over simply fish meal) and carotenoid boosts for better color. Compared to female Betta fish, males are noticeably slimmer and slower to move thanks to those long fins. Considering how aggressive males can be in courting the slight handicap is an aid to uninterested females. So long as a frustrated male Siamese Fighting fish is too slow to catch females, he can’t bully them too much.</p>
            <p>Female Betta fish are almost always slightly more subdued in tone and lack the trailing fins of males. However, some modern color varieties produce female Betta fish with color patterns equally as brilliant as their partners. Female Bettas are noticeably stouter as well compared to males. While it’s especially visible when she’s full of eggs females are thicker all around and not as long as full-grown males.</p>
        </aside>
        <aside role="complementary">
          <h4>Behavior</h4> 
          <p>Male Betta fish are famously intolerant of one another. Since they have been selectively bred for not only color but aggression, they will flare gills, perform fin displays, and attempt to bite even their own reflection when visible. Unlike most tropical fish, Male Betta fish don’t always back down due to exhaustion or surrender. He will continue giving chase until he can’t see the other male. Even if one male wins he may eventually die due to stress or infection.</p>
          <p>Male Betta fish are also bubble nest builders. If you’ve ever owned a Betta, then you’ve probably come across a small raft of bubbles along the glass edge or corner of an aquarium. In the wild male Bettas find floating plants and debris to anchor their bubble nests to. Once completed, he then seeks out and coaxes females back to his love raft. Their territorial fights keep other males away from spots with the thickest aquatic weeds and gentlest current.</p>
          <p>Female Betta fish have inherited the same aggressive genes passed down the line but don’t need to express them like males do. In fact, because female Betta fish tend to be more amiable and social, they can be kept together in betta sororities!

Common colors are solid blue and red. Red is the most dominant color, while purple and green are the rarest colors.

        <h3 id="patterns">Patterns</h3>
        <p>Patterns of Bettas have been created through selective breeding over the years. Patterns include but not limited to dragon scale, butterfly, marble, koi. Dragon Scale Bettas are known for its metallic coloration; its body scales appear like those of a lizard or dragon. Butterfly Bettas have a distinct color pattern where one solid color spreads from the body to the tail halfway. The other half is a paler or iridescent color like white. Marble Bettas have a marble-like pattern with colors that look blotchy and irregular. Koi Bettas, as their pattern name suggests, resemble the Koi pond fish.</p>
