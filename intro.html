        <h3 id="about">What are Betta Fishes?</h3>
        <p><b>Betta Splendens</b>, also known as the Siamese fighting fish or &ldquo;bettas&rdquo; for short, is a vibrantly-colored freshwater fish with long tails. Bettas are native to Southeast Asia, originating in river basins of Thailand. In the wild, bettas makes it home in rice paddies, drainage ditches, and flood plains where storm flooding and droughts are prevalent. Cyclic, drastic changes in its environment helped the fish to adapt - becoming a true labyrinth fish. A labyrinth fish has the unique ability to breathe oxygen directly from the air and also take in oxygen from its gills. As a result, bettas and other labyrinth fish can survive for short periods of time out of water and if needed, can inhale the air around them (provided they stay moist). Bettas can, therefore, sustain itself in stagnant, oxygen-deficient water.</p>    
      <p>Bettas are renowned as fighting fishes because they are very territorial in nature; they will flare their gills and fight with other bettas in confined spaces (often leading to injuries and death). Unlike other species, Bettas are not schooling fish and will fight with each other, regardless of gender. As a result, bettas are usally kept individually in separate tanks. Bettas prefer to swim alone and also need a comfortable place to hide. Click on <i>How to Setup Tank</i> and <i>Betta Care</i> if you want to learn more about raising a healthy betta fish!</p>

        <h3 id="history">History</h3>
        <p>Siamese fighting fish are endemic to the central plain of Thailand, where they were first domesticated at least 1,000 years ago, among the longest of any fish. They were initially bred for aggression and subject to gambling matches akin to cockfighting. Bettas became known outside Thailand through King Rama III (1788-1851), who is said to have given some to Theodore Cantor, a Danish physician, zoologist, and botanist. Their names come from an ancient clan of warriors, the &ldquo;Bettah&rdquo;, and was given its combatant name, Betta, when the fish became popular in the mid-1800s. They first appeared in the West in the late 19th century, and within decades became popular as ornamental fish. Their long history of selective breeding has produced a wide variety of coloration and finnage, earning them the moniker, "designer fish of the aquatic world".</p>

            <h4>Approximately 70 species of Betta</h4>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/49fcc96b-2ec8-4071-a8bf-498b0bbd5c76/Gif1.gif?v=1663877097062" alt="Colorful Betta" width="300" height="300">             <p>When most people think of Betta fish, they will probably think of Betta splendens, the Siamese fighting fish. But there are lots of different species within the Betta genus, including the Mekong fighting fish (<em>B. smaragdina</em>) and the Java fighting fish (<em>B. picta</em>), also known as the spotted betta.</p>

            <h4>Multiple Varieties of Betta Fish</h4>
            <p>The fish get their name from an ancient clan of warriors that were called the “Bettah.” They later came to be known as fighting fish because of the growing popularity of fish fighting as a sport during the 1800s, particularly in Thailand. Here, people would bet on the fish for their bravery rather than the damage they could inflict on their opponent. Betta fish are also occasionally known as &ldquo;plakat,&rdquo; especially the short-finned varieties. This comes from the Thai word plakad, which translates to &ldquo;biting fish.&rdquo; So, as you can probably deduce, Betta fish don’t have the friendliest reputation.

            <h4>Wild Bettas Are Very Different to Pet Store Bettas</h4>           
            <img src ="https://cdn.glitch.global/49fcc96b-2ec8-4071-a8bf-498b0bbd5c76/wild%20betta.jpg?v=1663877526007" alt="Wild Betta" width="300" height="300">
            <p>After many years of selective breeding for the ornamental trade, the iconic tail of the Betta fish comes in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The most common is the veil tail, but there are also crown tails, comb tails, half-moon tails, and double feathers, to name just a few.</p>
            <p>Bettas also come in a lot of different colors. Their skin contains several layers of pigment, going from red, yellow, black, iridescent (which consists of blue and green), and an outer layer that appears metallic, which changes how the other colors look. Different combinations of these layers can be present in any one individual, which is why there are so many color varieties in Betta fish.</p>

            <h4>Omnivorous when in Captivity</h4>
            <p>Betta fish living in an aquarium will eat a very varied diet. They can be fed flakes and pellets, as well as live or frozen foods like bloodworm, brine shrimp, and daphnia. They will even munch on vegetation if it’s available. You need to be careful, though, as they may also eat smaller tank mates if given the chance. Meanwhile, wild Betta fish are almost exclusively insectivores. They will eat insects, which they usually collect from the surface of the water, as well as aquatic insect larvae. They do not typically eat vegetation in their natural environment.</p>

            <h4>Male Bettas Build Nests Out of Bubbles</h4>
            <p>When it’s time to breed, male Bettas build a bubble nest at the water’s surface. When the female releases her eggs, the male releases his milt and fertilization occurs externally. The male then gathers the fertilized eggs and will spit them into the nest. But that’s just the beginning of the male’s job. He will then watch over the nest, repairing it as needed. He retrieves any eggs that sink away from the nest and protects all the eggs from predators until they hatch. He will even chase away the female as she tends to eat the eggs after spawning to replenish her energy.</p>
            <p>Fries hatch after just 24 to 36 hours and they remain in the nest for a few days, still under the male Betta’s protection. They live off a yolk sac for these first few days but, once this is fully absorbed, they are ready to venture out into the world.</p>

          <h4>Intelligent Fish</h4>
          <p>
          Bettas are one of the few fish that can learn to recognize their owners and perform tricks. You can teach your Betta fish to follow your finger around its tank or, if you have the equipment, they can learn to swim through hoops or to push a ball into a goal. They are incredibly fast learners and can be trained in much the same way as a dog, using food rewards.
