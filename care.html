    <p>Here is an overview of water change, food, tankmates, and exercise. Maintenance and care are crucial for bettas to thrive. A healthy betta would have a large appetite and exhibit bright colors, energetic movements, aggressiveness, flowing fins. A sick betta would exhibit physical signs such as faded colors, lethargic movements, abnormal swimming, loss of appetite, clamped tail <span>&</span> fins, and growths.</p>

        <h3 id="change">Water Change</h3>
        <p>Water change should be performed every 2-3 weeks. Betta can be kept in the tank or removed. First, turn off and take out the heater and filter. Use the gravel cleaner to clean and suction out water (depending on the size of the tank). Fill a bucket with clean water and add water conditioner. Next, clean the filter by rinsing it in the old tank water. Clean the tank glass, decors and trim the leaves if you have live plants. Ensure that the new water is around the same temperature as the old tank water before it is poured in. Lastly, plug in and turn on the heater and filter.</p>

        <h3 id="food">Food</h3>
        <!--Source used https://japanesefightingfish.org/betta-fish-feeding-instructions/ and personal knowledge-->
        <p>Bettas can be fed pellets, flakes, live or frozen food. Live or frozen food include bloodworms, mosquito larvae, daphnia, and brine shrimp. You can select any of of these food types to incorporate into your betta's diet based on preference. One thing to note is that you have to be careful not to overfeed your fish. Overfeeding can lead bloating and constipation. This is a very common mistake that can lead to betta fish not eating and serious health problems or worse the Betta fish dies. Keep in mind a betta fish’s stomach is not much larger than its eye – so it’s very easy to overfeed. Don’t be tricked into your betta’s large appetite, sometimes they would eat the whole pack if you tipped it in. They may look like they are hungry for more, but it is important not to overfeed them. Putting too much food in your tank has other negative effects as wasted food that is not cleaned up pollutes the water and makes your tank dirty. Any extra food in the tank will quickly begin to decompose. This, in turn, can lead to ammonia surges and other water quality problems.</p>        
        <p>Best advice is to feed a betta fish two small feeds per day. Feeding your betta fish once (2-3 medium-sized pellets) in the morning and once (2-3 pellets) at night every day is great. Making these feeds around 12 hours apart and at the same time, every day will help you and your betta get in a routine. Some owners opt to fast their betta fish for 24 hours once every 10-14 days. This day of fasting helps reduce the chance of constipation. You can give treats of live food, such as freeze-dried or frozen blood worms, 2-3 times weekly.</p>
        <p>How to feed betta fish depends on the actual food type.  Some you can release directly into the tank, while others require some preparation. Fish food flakes are the worst thing you can feed bettas and other freshwater fish. Concerning betta fish feeding, their mouths don’t do well when trying to consume flakes. Even if you crumble up the flakes, it is hard to get the right size. Flakes that are too small will fall to the bottom of the tank and rot. Flakes that are too big can choke the betta to death. It is very sad to see a betta, or any other tropical fish, with its mouth, stuck open as it dies because flake-based foods got caught in its throat. Unfortunately, flakes that are wet enough from the water can also cause this problem because they will stick in place. Pellets are a much better option. Be sure to choose micro-pellet-sized bites. It is also best to avoid pellets that sink rapidly to the bottom of the tank. As an answer to the question “how many pellets to feed a betta fish?”, it depends on how many times a day you are feeding the fish.  If it is just once a day, then give the fish 7 – 8 pellets.  Divide this in half or into as many as you need for different feeding schedules.</p>

        <h3 id="tankmates">Tankmates</h3>
         <!--Source used https://bettasource.com/tankmates-for-betta/-->
        <p>Although it's optimal to keep bettas alone, some options for tankmates include cory catfish, tetras, molly fish, platies, shrimp, etc. Keep in mind that tankmates may have different requirements for tank size and environment.      
        </p>
          <div class = "tankmates">
            <h4>Cories</h4>  
            <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/49fcc96b-2ec8-4071-a8bf-498b0bbd5c76/catfish.webp?v=1664065587633" alt="Cories" width="300" height="300"><br>Cories (Corydora Catfish/Corycats/Corys) are yet another fine tank-mate possibility. There are quite a few different types of Cories that you can choose from, but they all share something in common. They are bottom-feeding fish. Betta fish tend to swim closer to the surface more often than not, and cories are always at the bottom. Because of this, fighting due to territorial disputes rarely happens. Cories are a particularly peaceful species of fish in general. These mini catfish tend to do better in groups though. A 10-gallon betta aquarium could do fine with 3-4 Corycats. Anything less than ten gallons would be too small. So far, Cories are the only type of fish species on this tank mate guide. However, they are at the top of the list of fish species that can share a tank with your betta. They are very easy keepers and quite peaceful as well. These are both very good things to look for. Nobody wants a betta tank full of drama.</p>

            <h4>Neon Tetras</h4>  
            <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/49fcc96b-2ec8-4071-a8bf-498b0bbd5c76/tetra.jpeg?v=1664065695893" alt="Neon Tetra" width="300" height="300"><br>Starting off the runner up list is the Neon Tetra. We are starting here because they share almost all of the same characteristics with the White Cloud Mountain Minnow that was written about just above. The major difference, and the reason why they didn’t make the top list, is that Neon Tetras can be very brightly colored. Betta fish are attracted to brightly colored and flashy things. In the case of betta fish, being “attracted to” means more of an “I will attack and eat you” kind of thing. Lucky for the neon tetra, they are surprisingly speedy little fish. They can, and do, outpace a hungry or threatened betta fish, but don’t always win that race. If you don’t mind losing the occasional neon tetra or two by way of angry betta monster, then these fish are otherwise fine in the same aquarium. Neon Tetras like swimming in schools. Having a group of 5 or so in a ten-gallon tank is necessary for the tetras to stay healthy (and un-eaten). It would be in the tetra’s best interest if you were to provide plenty of places to escape and hide in as well.</p>

          <div class = "tankmates">
            <h4>Platies</h4>  
            <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/49fcc96b-2ec8-4071-a8bf-498b0bbd5c76/platy.jpeg?v=1664065598242" alt="Platies" width="300" height="300"><br>If you read the description above about mollies, you will know that Platies like their water on the harder side with a high pH level. Platies are also notorious nippers of fins. Betta fish have really pretty and long fins. Betta fish might not have pretty and long fins for long if you decide to go with Platies as companions.</p>
          </div>
    
          <div class = "tankmates">
            <h4>Mollies</h4>  
            <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/49fcc96b-2ec8-4071-a8bf-498b0bbd5c76/mollies.jpeg?v=1664065589714" alt="Mollies" width="300" height="300"><br>Mollies are similar to platies in that they enjoy, or rather need, water that is relatively hard and keeps a high pH level. If you have done your homework on betta fish, you will instantly see why this poses a problem. Betta fish need pretty much just the opposite of this. On top of this, mollies are known to be quite aggressive at times. Generally, aggression from mollies occurs when there is not adequate space in the tank to divvy up the territory between a betta and itself. Mollies can reach a good 3 inches if raised in a five-gallon aquarium.
If you find yourself desperately needing to try and keep a mollie in the same tank as a betta, the lesser of two evils are the type with shorter tails. Mollies with Long, flashy tails are just begging a betta fish to fight.</p>

          <div class = "tankmates">
            <h4>Ghost Shrimps</h4>  
            <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/49fcc96b-2ec8-4071-a8bf-498b0bbd5c76/shrimp.jpg?v=1664065586307" alt="Ghost Shrimp" width="300" height="300"><br> Ghost shrimp are another type that survives fairly well in a betta’s aquarium. As their name implies, Ghost shrimp have translucent bodies. This is fortunate for the Ghost shrimp as that constant camouflage makes them harder to spot by an overly ambitious betta fish.</p>

        <h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
         <!--Source used https://www.bettacarefishguide.com/do-betta-fish-like-mirrors/-->
        <p>Believe it or not mirrors are beneficial to use in front of bettas, and the primary purpose is so that your bettas can exercise. Using a mirror isn’t going to be harmful to your betta but overusing a mirror can be. While your betta is going to become stressed when he sees his reflection it’s good stress. And as long as you don’t leave it to the point he’s becoming exhausted or manic then it’s not going to be harmful. It’s well worth using a mirror because the benefits definitely outweigh the disadvantages. You should show your betta their reflection for about 30-45 seconds per day; it really depends on what your betta responds to. The most important thing is to make sure you’re watching your betta to make sure he’s not being too stressed out.</p>
        <p>Mirrors are beneficial because it lets them fulfill their natural instinct and flare as they see their  reflection. Bettas are fighting fish and they have a natural instinct to fight. If they don’t feel like they’re hunting, chasing or trying to mate then they could become depressed.
By showing your betta his own reflection, he’s going to think a competitor is entering his territory. Once he’s chased it for a while and you move the mirror away, then he’ll think he’s ‘won’. Short periods of stress followed by the victory is good for your betta and it will help keep him happy. Did you know that flaring can help your betta if he’s suffering from constipation? Because your betta will be flexing and tensing all kinds of muscles when he’s flaring it’s not uncommon for him to flush his bowels. If you think overfeeding has caused constipation and nothing more sinister then this can be a great way to help him recover. Mirrors also help remove pent up aggression, encourages breeding behavior, prevents boredom. One of the quickest ways you can snap your betta out of boredom is by showing him his own reflection. After he sees his reflection, he’s going to start patrolling his tank in an attempt to make sure no other rivals try to steal his territory. Patrolling is going to keep him entertained and stop any boredom.</p>
